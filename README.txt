==============

This C++ package is a simplified Version (pure c++ Library) for
"Automating Image Morphing using Structural Similarity on a Halfway Domain ï¼ˆSiggraph 2014)"

It has been successfully compiled in the x64 Windows with the compiler Visual Studio 2013. The CPUMorph Library has no other dependency. While the example project which show just how to use the CPUMorph Library requires the OpenCV Library.
